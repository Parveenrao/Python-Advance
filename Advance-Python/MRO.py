"""MRO (Method Resolution Order) is the order in which Python looks for a method/attribute when it is called on an object.

It is especially important in multiple inheritance, because a class can inherit from multiple parents, 
and we need a consistent way to decide which parentâ€™s method runs first.


Avoids ambiguity in multiple inheritance.

Ensures all parents get initialized exactly once (important in diamond problem).

Works with super() to make cooperative multiple inheritance possible.
