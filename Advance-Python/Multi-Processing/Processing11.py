"""" Python Concurrent Features 
     Concurrent features is all about making parallelism and concurrency easier
     
     You have to create, start, and manage each Thread manually.

     If you have 100 tasks, you need to manage 100 threads. Thatâ€™s messy.
     
     Thats why we need threadpoolexecutor and poolexeccutor
