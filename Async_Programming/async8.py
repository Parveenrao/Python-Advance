# Taskgroup is a way to run multiple async task togther in structured and safe manner

"""  It's a manager for your task 
     
     Start task together 
     Wait until all finish 
     Cancel the group if one fails 
     Prevent 'orphan' task from  hanging in the background"""
     
     
# without taskgroup , you will use use gather but this will not cancel the task if one task fails

# Imagine u want to send emails to 3 person at one time 
# one email to Alice
# one email to bob
# one eamil to charlie    


# If one email fails (e.g., server down), we want to stop the whole batch. Thatâ€™s exactly what TaskGroup does.
