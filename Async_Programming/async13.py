# Synchronization Primitive in asynchronous Programming

""" What are they and why we need them  
     In async program multiple coroutines run concurrently on the same thread.
     Synchronization primitive coordinate access to shared state , control concurrency and let corountine wait for signal
     so you avoid race conditions, lost update , deadlock and uncontrolled usage.)"""

"""Imagine a canteen with food trays:

If a consumer comes but no tray is available, they wait outside the canteen.

When a producer puts food on the tray, they shout ‚Äúnotify!‚Äù ‚Üí a waiting person wakes up and enters.

It gives exclusive access (lock).

It lets consumers wait until the producer notifies them"""
